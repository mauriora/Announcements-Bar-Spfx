# Rateable-Announcements Sharepoint extension

## Introduction

This is an example of announcements bar in the Sharepoint, featuring out of the box features like likes.

The solution is part of the [reusable hybrid repo mvc spfx examples](https://github.com/mauriora/reusable-hybrid-repo-mvc-spfx-examples).

This one hopefully illustrates:

- create a model extended from existing SharePoint Announcements for the SharePoint access
- use out of the box features like likes, comments
- little specific code needed

## Getting Started

You can use the "Minimal path to awesomeness" to have look around.
You can follow the "Create a new project" to start with a copy of this a starting point for a new extension project.

### Requirements

You should have the following installed:

- Code editor
- Node 14
- yarn
- GitExtension (the program, if your contributing or forking a new project of this)

### Minimal path to awesomeness

#### Create the content type

![Content type hierarchy diagram](./docs/Content-Type.svg)

Create a new content type as child of the builtin `Announcement`, e.g. `Announcement Extended`.
Add from existing site columns:

- Owner (`ReportOwner`)
- Start Date (`StartDate`)
- `URL`

> `Urgent` (create as YesNo if it doesn't exist)

If you can't create content-types, add the `Announcement Extended` fields manually to your list, **after** you created it with the builtin `Announcements` content type.
If you can't find all the site columns in existing ones, then you can add them manually.

#### Create the list

1. To be able to deploy the extension tenant wide without configuration, create the lists *__Announcements__*  and *__AcknowledgedAnnouncements__* on the site *__/sites/news__*
2. Open *__SiteContent__* on the site that will host the _Announcements_ list containing the announcements
3. Create the _announcement_ list
4. In the settings:
    - Advanced settings
        - Enable management of content types
        - Disable attachments
    - Rating settings (this seems to only appear on team sites)
        - Rating Settings: **Yes** or (No if you want to disable ratings)
        - Which voting/rating experience you would like to enable for this list?
            - Likes if you want to show the Thumbs icon and count
            - Star Ratings if you want to show the 5-star rating
    - Add from existing content types
        - Add your previous created content type. If it doesn't show, wait for up to 4 hours
    - Click on the default item content type
        - delete this content type
5. The Coulmns should look like:

    | Column | Type | Used in | Comment |
    |--------|------|---------|---------|
    | Body    | Multiple lines of text | Announcement Extended | |
    | Created | Date and Time | | |
    | Expires | Date and Time | Announcement Extended | |
    | Modified | Date and Time | | |
    | Number of Likes | Number of Likes | If you have/had like ratings enabled |
    | Number of Ratings | Number of Ratings | If you have/had star ratings enabled |
    | Owner | Person or Group | Announcement Extended | |
    | Rating (0-5) | Rating (0-5) | | If you have/had star ratings enabled |
    | Start Date | Date and Time | Announcement Extended | |
    | Title | Single line of text | Announcement Extended | |
    | Urgent | Yes/No | Announcement Extended | |
    | URL | Hyperlink or Picture | Announcement Extended | |
    | Created By | Person or Group | | |
    | Modified By | Person or Group | | |
    
6. Create the _acknowledged_ list
7. In the settings:
    - Advanced settings
        - **Read access** select `Read items that were created by the user`
        - **Create and Edit access** select `Create items and edit items that were created by the user`
        - Disable attachments

### Serve the extension

```shell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mauriora/Rateable-Announcements-Solution.git
cd Rateable-Announcements-Solution
yarn install
code .
```

Edit `app\Rateable-Announcements-Extension\config\serve.json`

- set *pageUrl* to the spage you want to test your extension on
- in properties, set listname and siteurl

open a terminal in the solution (root) folder

```shell
yarn build-shared
yarn serve
```

a browser will open and navigate to *pageUrl*

## Build and install

For the likes to work, the list needs to be on a site with option to enable ratings on lists.

1. In a solution terminal execute `yarn build-app`
2. [browse to the sharepoint app store on *YOUR-TENANT*](https://YOUR-TENANT.sharepoint.com/sites/apps/AppCatalog/Forms/AllItems.aspx)
3. Click **Upload**
4. Click **Choose files**
5. Navigate to *YOUR-SOLUTION*/apps/*YOUR-PROJECT*/sharepoint/solution
6. Select *YOUR-PROJECT*.sppkg and click **Open**
7. Add a comment and click **OK**
8. Wait for the upload to finish and a dialog to open
9. If you want the EXTENSION to be available on all sites without installing, tick **Make this solution available to all sites in the organization**, otherwise it needs to be installed on each site using
10. Click **Deploy**
11. If you didn't deploy tenant wide:
    1. go to the *__site content__* of the site you want to add the announcement toolbar
    2. Click *__+ New Ë…__*
    3. Select *__App__*
    4. Select *__Mauri-Ora-Rateable Annoncements__*
12. If you didn't host Announcements on sites/news, then you need to open PowerShell to add the extension to each site
    1. `Connect-PnPOnline -Url https://YOUR-TENANT.sharepoint.com/sites/YourSite`
    2. Modify the `{'listName': 'Announcements', 'acknowledgedListName': 'AcknowledgedAnnouncements', 'siteUrl': '/sites/News'}` to point to your site containing your announcements _announcement_ list and _acknowledged_ list from earlier:

        Depending on your pnp / powershell version, the `ClientSideComponentProperties` need to be escaped different:

        ``Add-PnPCustomAction -Name "Mauri-Ora-Rateable-Announcements" -Title "Mauri-Ora-Rateable-Announcements" -Location "ClientSideExtension.ApplicationCustomizer" -ClientSideComponentId "188a73d9-a68e-381e-4625-a5f0cf7c0024" -ClientSideComponentProperties "{ `"listName`": `"Announcements`", `"acknowledgedListName`": `"AcknowledgedAnnouncements`", `"siteUrl`": `"/sites/News`"}"``

        or

        ``Add-PnPCustomAction -Name "Mauri-Ora-Rateable-Announcements" -Title "Mauri-Ora-Rateable-Announcements" -Location "ClientSideExtension.ApplicationCustomizer" -ClientSideComponentId "188a73d9-a68e-381e-4625-a5f0cf7c0024" -ClientSideComponentProperties "{'listName': 'Announcements', 'acknowledgedListName': 'AcknowledgedAnnouncements', 'siteUrl': '/sites/News'}"``

        If you have issues, check the browser logs, "Announcements onInit" logs an object with an properties object containing _listName_, _acknowledgedListName_ and _siteUrl_

13. Create a page and add **YOUR-EXTENSION**

## Contribute

Use the minmal path to awesomeness and please create a branch for your contribution.
Then do a pull request to merge your branch into the main branch.

## Create new project

1. Fork the solution as *YOUR-SOLUTION*
2. Clone the forked solution
3. Fork the starting app project as *YOUR-PROJECT*
4. Add the *YOUR-PROJECT* as submodule to *YOUR-SOLUTION* using the app GitExtenson, manage sub modules
5. Remove the starting project, and any other you don't need, from YOUR-solution using the app GitExtenson, manage sub modules
6. call `yarn initguids` in apps/*YOUR-PROJECT*
6.a replace guids in server.json, elements.xml and  clientsideinstances.xml
7. rename *YOUR-.....* in:
    - app/*YOUR-PROJECT*
        - package.json
        - src/extensions/*YOUR-EXTENSION*
            - *YOUR-EXTENSION*.manifest.json
        - config
            - config.json
            - package-solution.json
        - sharepoint/assets/*
8. Copy the *id* value from *YOUR-EXTENSION*.manifest.json as *componentId*, and the *alias* value as *title*  to
